# Coffee Retail Chain - Sales Dashboard & Analysis  
- Description: Tableau dashboards and sales analysis storyboard for a coffee retail chain  
- Created: 6/10/23    
  
## Overview:  
- For this project, I created an imaginary retail chain called "The Bucks Coffee & Tea".  
- Acting as an analyst for The Bucks, I developed market and product performance dashboards for calendar years 2012 and 2013.  
- I then analyzed 2013 performance and created an executive summary as a Tableau storyboard.

    - Cumulative Sales by Market: Line Chart  
    - Profit by Market: Packed Bubble Chart
